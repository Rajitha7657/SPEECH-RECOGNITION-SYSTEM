# SMALL DISCRIPTION OF THE SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM :

Speech to Text & Text to Speech App Summary: This app utilizes Streamlit, SpeechRecognition, and pyttsx3 libraries to create a simple interactive tool that listens to the user's voice, converts it to text, and can read it back aloud. The app features two main functionalities: speech-to-text (where the app transcribes spoken words into written text using Google's Web Speech API) and text-to-speech (where the app uses pyttsx3 to read the transcribed text aloud). Users can start the recording by pressing a button, and once the speech is recognized, the transcribed text is displayed, with an option to hear it spoken out loud. Error handling is included for failed audio recognition or API issues.
